## Cheetahs in Code

Cheetahs are normal animals, but something interesting about the name cheetah is that there is something called Cheetah. 
[Cheetah](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/cheetah) in code is a tool that predicts the detonation velocities and energy released. 
I wish that I could post the code to this, but I am pretty sure its very top secret.
