# History of myself
 
I went to Fort Zumwalt South High School. I played soccer there for the 4 years I was there. I started on the varsity team 3 years and was pulled up at the end of my freshman year.
This is what drove me into playing soccer at the highest level for a school. I had a variety of places to play after college, but since I did not know what I wanted to study I decided on community college.
I played at St. Charles Community College for two years. This was a great place for me to find out what I wanted to study. I played a lot of different positions in my time playing soccer. 

- Winger
- Defender
- Forward

My coach did not know where to put me and this resulted in me playing everywhere on the field. I finally found a sweet spot in defense. This is where I would go up against people that were a lot bigger than me.
I am not the biggest person and going against all these bigger players it made me realise that I had to bully them off the ball and be faster and stronger.
I used all this to my advantage and did well considering my size. This is what I enjoy most. I enjoy playing sports and competing against other people.
