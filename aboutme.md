# About Me

I am a Junior at Mizzou right now. I am majoring in IT. I just recently changed it from CS to this.
My major was not always so easy to know. I have changed my major so many times.

1. Business
2. Chemistry
3. Computer Science
4. Physical Therapy

The above list is the different majors I have gone through since I have been in college. I feel like
it is very hard to determine where you want to go in life through one major. I feel like since I have been
through so many majors I have see what each are like and I know what I like best about my major.

I have made some code in the time that I have learned it.
**This is code for an advanced calulator in Python.** I used this as a guide. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Rbtc5gpsw)

'num1 = float(input("Enter First Number: "))
op = print("Enter operater: ")
num2 = float(input("Enter Second Number: "))

If op == "+":
    print(num1 + num2)
elif op == "-":
    print(num1 - num2)
elif op == "/":
    print(num1 / num2)
elif op == "*":
    print(num1 * num2)
else:
    print("Invalid Entry. Try Again.") '

This was generally easy to make once you know what different data types do.
I enjoyed doing this and once I created this it sparked my interest even more 
and made me want to code even more.
